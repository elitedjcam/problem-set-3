  <h2>Game Modes and Difficulties</h2>
  <p>Minecraft as of today has two game modes; Survival and Creative. Creative gives players unlimited materials and flight, 
  allowing them to do whatever they want with the world they're in. Survival is the meat of this discussion.</p>
  <p>There are also six difficulty modes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Peaceful</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>Normal</li>
      <li>Hard</li>
      <li>Hardcore</li>
      <li>Adventure</li>
    </ol>
  <!--Put a picture of the difficulty screen here-->
  <p>The difficulties are ordered from easiest to the most difficult.
    Peaceful mode is the easiest due to the complete erasure of hunger depletion and mobs.
    Easy to Hard mode has mobs and hunger, but as difficulty increases, the amount of damage mobs 
    do to you will be increased. Hardcore is all of this, but with the highest amount of damage that mobs deal to you
    and without natural health regeneration. Adventure mode only allows you break block with the appropriate tool (i.e. dirt and shovels,
    stone and pickaxes). It's probably not as difficult at the other modes, but it sure is annoying.</p>
  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <h3>Movement</h3>
  <p>Minecraft is awfully simple, since everything is tied to whatever keys you bind them to.
    You can move, strafe, jump, sneak, fight, mine, and even fish with whatever keys you use.
    But that's nearly every game. So what makes this game unique?</p>
  <h3>Crafting</h3>
  <p>Minecraft was one of the first few games that utilized a manual crafting model. You place materials into
    a specific pattern  and out comes the crafted item. Update 1.12/1.13 came with an in-game crafting guide, 
    but before that, you had to figure out for yourself. You can craft a variety of tools, armor, weapons (no, not guns, don't ask),
    and a good amount of utility and vanity items.</p>
  <h3>Mining and Building</h3>
  <p>All of the blocks, besides bedrock, are destructible. To mine blocks, just click and hold on the block until 
    it breaks. However, you must use the right tool to mine it or else it will be mined slower, or worse, you don't get the 
    expected reward. Now, once you get your materials, you can just place them down and start building. 
    Certain materials are locked behind extra steps, such as smelting/cooking, but once you get going, the possibilities are endless!
  <h3>Combat</h3>
  <p>This is the last part of the little guide: Combat. Remember when I said to click and hold on blocks? If you just click, you hit something.
    If you hit another entity, for example, just a random cow, you damage it. If you hit it enough, it dies and you get beef and leather from it.
    Different entities give different items. Mobs that would actively try to damage you would be hostile mobs such as the zombie.
    Mobs that attack you after you hit them are docile, in which one example would be the wolf. Lastly, mobs that flee when they are hit are passive
    mobs. With the materials you are bound to get, you can craft tools, weapon and armor. Axes, bows and swords 
    deal the most damage to mobs. Armor mitigates the damage dealed to you from <em>almost</em> all sources. As of 1.12, there is
    a delay between swings for a damage boost aside from spam-clicking.</p>

  <p>So, that is it for the basics. If you want more in-depth guides, look for the Minecraft guide books or
