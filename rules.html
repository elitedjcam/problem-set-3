  <h2>Game Modes and Difficulties</h2>
  <p>Minecraft as of today has two game modes; Survival and Creative. Creative gives players unlimited materials and flight, 
  allowing them to do whatever they want with the world they're in. Survival is the meat of this discussion.</p>
  <p>There are also five difficulty modes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Peaceful</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>Normal</li>
      <li>Hard</li>
      <li>Hardcore</li>
      <li>Adventure</li>
    </ol>
  <!--Put a picture of the difficulty screen here-->
  <p>The difficulties are ordered from easiest to the most difficult.
    Peaceful mode is the easiest due to the complete erasure of hunger depletion and mobs.
    Easy to Hard mode has mobs and hunger, but as difficulty increases, the amount of damage mobs 
    do to you will be increased. Hardcore is all of this, but without natural health regeneration and 
    the highest amount of damage that mobs deal to you.
  <h2>Basics</h2>
  <h3>Movement</h3>
  <p>Minecraft is awfully simple, since everything is tied to whatever keys you bind them to.
    You can move, strafe, jump, sneak, fight, mine, and even fish with whatever keys you use.
    But that's nearly every game. So what makes this game unique?</p>
  <h3>Crafting</h3>
  <p>Minecraft was one of the first few games that utilized a manual crafting model. You place materials into
    a specific pattern  and out comes the crafted item. Update 1.12/1.13 came with an in-game crafting guide, 
    but before that, you had to figure out for yourself. You can craft a variety of tools, armor, weapons (no, not guns, don't ask),
    and a good amount of utility and vanity items.</p>
  <h3>Mining and Building</h3>
  <p>All of the blocks, besides bedrock, are destructible. To mine blocks, just click and hold on the block until 
    it breaks. However, you must use the right tool to mine it or else it will be mined slower, or worse, you don't get the 
    expected reward, like this unfortunate individual. Fair warning though, please don't mind his naughty language. I want a good grade.

    As you can see, he is extremely disappointed as to his apparent lack of diamonds.
    But to be fair, he didn't listen to his Twitch chat, so that's his fault.
    Now, once you get your materials, you can just place them down and start building. 
    Certain materials are locked behind extra steps, such as smelting/cooking, but once you get going, the possibilities are endless!
