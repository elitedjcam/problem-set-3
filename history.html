      <p>The creator of Minecraft, Markus "Notch" Persson, y'know, just felt like making a game.
         After playing games such as Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, he was inspired to
         develop Minecraft as a side project. The first-person and blocky aspects of the game
         was inspired by Infiniminer. Minecraft was first released to the public on
         May 17, 2009. The game was further tested by the community, gathering feedback, and was improving.
         The game was fully released November 18, 2011.</p>
