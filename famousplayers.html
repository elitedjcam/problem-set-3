  <p>Popular Youtuber and meme expert Grandayy has a second channel titled grande1899. There, he has uploaded
    a multitude of minecraft noteblock covers. Basically he takes song and remakes them with note blocks entirely by ear.
    One of his more popular covers is on the song Africa by Toto <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKli-d8QMLg" target="_blank">(click here)</a>
    Here is also a link to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6TeYZ2DlueFRne5DyAnyg/featured" target="_blank">meme channel</a> and
    his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/grande1899/videos" target="_blank">note block channel</a>.</p>

    and fellow Youtubers. His channel can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JackSucksAtMinecraft" target="_blank">here.</a>

  <p>There are many more Youtubers who came before these individuals such as:</p>
